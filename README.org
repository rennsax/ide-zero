#+title: ide-zero.el - Make Emacs IDE-like!
#+author: rennsax

#+begin_quote
WIP: this project is still in development! Some features are missing. But I'll
be happy if you can try it out. If you use flycheck and Eglot at this moment,
ide-zero works just fine.

Ide-zero provides a useful macro: ~ide-zero-define~ which can be used to
configure IDE features (linting, LSP, etc.) in a breeze, without caring about
the implementation under the hood.
